# Perfect Timing App w/ React, Vite, ESLint & Tailwind

## About

Perfect Timing is a small-scale application designed for precise timing and training the user's reaction speed. In this application, the player needs to start a timer and attempt to stop it as close as possible to a set time. The application has been developed using modern web development technologies, such as React, Vite, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.

This application utilizes React's Refs and Portals features. Refs enable direct manipulation of DOM elements in React components, while Portals allow for the rendering of child components into separate DOM nodes from their parents.

### Project Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the application locally:

**1. Navigate to the Project Directory:** To begin setting up the application, first navigate to the project's main directory with the following command:

```
cd Refs-Portals
```

This ensures that you are in the right directory before proceeding with the setup.

**2. Install Dependencies:** Next, install all the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the command:

```
npm install
```

This command downloads and installs all dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

**3. Start the Development Server:** Finally, you can launch the development server by running:

```
npm run dev
```

After executing this command, the application will be up and running, accessible in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

### React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
